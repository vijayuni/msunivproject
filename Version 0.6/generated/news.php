Both films were so diametrically opposed, after all, that the competition took on a slightly tribal air. Just who do you stand for? Drama or comedy? Joy or fear? Female empowerment or the death of tens of thousands of Japanese civilians?</p><p>But then something bizarre happened. Instead of picking just one film, people started latching onto the idea of seeing Barbie and Oppenheimer together, on the same day, as part of a wildly incongruous double bill. Tom Cruise said he was going to do it. Greta Gerwig posed with tickets to both. Despite spending the last few weeks looking palpably baffled by having to play 400 tinpot YouTube parlour games just to promote his movie, Christopher Nolan also seemed fairly into the idea as well.

She was a performer with that interesting distinction of being Anglo-French, which somehow added to her unlocatable quality: she was quite at home with both languages, like other stars Charlotte Rampling, Kristin Scott Thomas and, indeed, Charlotte Gainsbourg, Birkin’s daughter with Serge Gainsbourg.</p><p>It was her destiny to be thought of as a public figure and national treasure in France, where she made a great many films, and to be placed on an odd kind of pedestal as icon or 60s darling. She had been a fashion model in real life and played them on screen, like the ones in Michelangelo Antonioni’s Blow-Up, where she made her startling first proper screen impression. And yet this doesn’t do justice to her distinctive screen work, her later character roles and her tremendous capacity for creative friendship and collaboration with film-makers such as Agnès Varda and Jean-Luc Godard.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/jul/16/jane-birkin-a-tremendous-screen-presence-with-a-gift-for-creative-collaboration">Continue reading...</a></div><span class="date">Published on: Sun, 16 Jul 2023 17:22:53 GMT</span><div class="similar" style="display:none;"><h2><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/jun/30/alan-arkin-character-actor" target="_blank">Alan Arkin was an actor of humour and candour who became a fierce screen presence | Peter Bradshaw</a></h2><div class="description"><p>In films ranging from Catch-22 to Little Miss Sunshine, Arkin was renowned for the technical virtuosity he brought to each role of his colossal career</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/jun/30/alan-arkin-oscar-winning-actor-little-miss-sunshine-dies-aged-89">Alan Arkin, Oscar winning actor in Little Miss Sunshine, dies aged 89</a></li><li><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/gallery/2023/jun/30/alan-arkin-a-life-in-pictures">Alan Arkin: a life in pictures</a></li></ul><p>Tough, unsentimental, witty, gravel-voiced and bullet-headed, Alan Arkin was a wiry character actor and comic presence who had a colossal career on stage, TV and movies. He came from the era of male stars such as Walter Matthau, Jack Lemmon, Ben Gazzara, Robert Duvall and Peter Falk – actors who projected a kind of take-it-or-leave-it pugnacity, integrity and strength. The always sympathetic and technically brilliant Arkin perhaps came into his own late in life, his face and shaven head morphing into a black-comic skull of derision and hilarity as the outrageous old guy who says what he wants because he’s decided he doesn’t care any more what people think … that’s if he ever did care.</p><p>In 2006, Arkin won the best supporting actor Academy Award for the part of Edwin Hoover, the chaotic old grandpa with the no-bullshit honesty in Little Miss Sunshine. Edwin is part of a bizarre dysfunctional extended family who hit the road in a VW van to get his little granddaughter Olive (played by Abigail Breslin) from New Mexico to California, where she will compete in a junior beauty pageant in questionable taste called “Little Miss Sunshine”. It is Arkin’s cheerfully unfiltered, unedited grandpa who has the most authentically sunny disposition and keeps saying tactless stuff, having been thrown out of his care home for taking heroin.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/jun/30/alan-arkin-character-actor">Continue reading...</a></div><span class="date">Published on: Fri, 30 Jun 2023 15:39:50 GMT</span></div></div><hr><div class='item'><h2><a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/04/17/media/dominion-fox-news-allegations/index.html" target="_blank">Here are the 20 specific Fox broadcasts and tweets Dominion says were defamatory</a></h2><div class="description">• Fox-Dominion trial delay 'is not unusual,' judge says

This may seem quaint in the digital age, but it raises important questions</p><p>When the British Board of Film Classification (BBFC) changes its certificate for an old movie, it is generally to ease up a bit and concede, like strict parents letting their teens have a glass of wine at dinner, that all right, times have changed. The Alien movies were once rated 18; now they’re 15.<br /><br />However, the recent decision to upgrade the 1978 animated version of Watership Down – the much-loved wild rabbit adventure – from U to PG (Parental Guidance) is a remarkable example of the censoring authority becoming more puritanical over time. Watership Down is violent apparently, with “bloody bite and claw injuries”. To which we can only say: yes. The overwhelming threat of violence is part of what has made Watership Down so compelling. Who can forget the terrifying figure of General Woundwort? Maybe Watership Down should be an 18 certificate, like all those children’s movies which were once routinely allowed to be terrifying and upsetting. Death of Bambi’s mum? 18. Child catcher in Chitty Chitty Bang Bang? 18. Kaa’s creepy eyes in The Jungle Book? 18.</p><p>But of course, the BBFC isn’t just there to protect us from sex and violence etc. It is there to protect us from the past with all its inappropriate assumptions about what is and isn’t offensive. I like to imagine James Ferman, secretary of what was in those days called the British Board of Film Censors, saying to his colleagues over a good lunch: “Look, nature is red in tooth and claw and a children’s cartoon robustly showing this is perfectly all right. Cleared for newborns and above!”<br /><br />But are young people really going to be triggered by Hazel, Fiver, Bigwig and their Peckinpah-esque ordeal? Or is the whole idea of distinguishing between U and PG a quaint absurdity to children who have long since mastered the art of disabling the parental restrictions on their iPhones? The BBFC might well find they have in no way restricted access to Watership Down, but there is something pleasing about the focus on film history, a way to make this old movie new and debate worthy and alive, blood dripping from its claw.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/jul/21/no-more-newborns-watership-down-has-been-upgraded-to-a-pg-itll-still-terrify-children">Continue reading...</a></div><span class="date">Published on: Fri, 21 Jul 2023 14:38:01 GMT</span></div><hr><div class='item'><h2><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2023/jul/22/the-open-2023-third-round-updates-live-golf" target="_blank">The Open 2023: third round updates – live</a></h2><div class="description"><ul><li><a href="https://www.theopen.com/leaderboard">Official leaderboard</a> | <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/jul/21/brian-harman-hunts-first-major-but-mcilroy-not-ruling-himself-out-of-open">Harmon hunts first major title</a></li><li>And you can share your thoughts with Scott <a href="mailto:scott.murray.casual@theguardian.com">via mail</a></li></ul><p><strong>Opening birdie for Rory McIlroy!</strong> He wedges his second pin high, and rolls in the 12-footer that remains.

The big horror series prolong their popularity on the strength of a monster (Freddy, Jason, Michael Myers and the rest of the Halloween costume perennials) or a narrative device (the self-inflicted torture of Saw, the Rube Goldberg inevitability of fate in Final Destination), but the Insidious pictures have yielded four windfalls over $100m despite a lack of any distinctive features. The unifying premise for hit factory Blumhouse’s reliable yet reliably uninteresting moneymaker dares viewers to wonder “what if there was a creepy thing that jumped out at you, then disappeared?” The closest it gets to a recurring mascot is a Darth Maul-looking phantom alternately referred to by fans as The Man With Fire in His Face, Lipstick-Face Demon, The Red-Faced Demon, or Sixtass, and in any case, he’s pretty light on charisma.</p><p>The first few chapters benefited hugely from the steady directorial hands of James Wan and Leigh Whannell, genre guys with strong fundamentals who knew how to use the camera to coax every iota of tension from material unremarkable on paper. This time around, the star Patrick Wilson takes the reins and reveals just how little has held the property together up to this point. Without innovative blocking and framing, each scene follows a rote repetition as clichés of studio-horror storytelling cue up the oldest scares in the book. Some lumpy mumbling about repression and cycles of generational trauma, a figure appears out of focus in the background, a moment of silence to foster a false sense of security, and then the cinematic equivalent of grabbing someone’s shoulders and screaming “BOO!” in their ear. If these cheap tricks garner a reaction at all, it’s to their suddenness and loudness, a knee-jerk agitation nowhere near as affecting as true, unleaded terror.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/jul/07/insidious-the-red-door-review-shoddy-horror-sequel">Continue reading...</a></div><span class="date">Published on: Fri, 07 Jul 2023 13:00:23 GMT</span></div><hr><div class='item'><h2><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/jul/06/joy-ride-review-slickly-likable-asian-american-comedy-dwells-on-family-and-identity" target="_blank">Joy Ride review – slickly likable Asian-American comedy dwells on family and identity</a></h2><div class="description"><p>Laughs, high energy levels and some outrageous set pieces make this examination of the complex relationship with distant family a fun journey of self-discovery</p><p>Writer-producer Adele Lim, who worked on the script for Crazy Rich Asians, now makes her feature directing debut with this likable and brash Asian-American comedy about four women leaving the US for a trip to the Chinese homeland; they come to terms with their roots in various ways, expressing sexualities queer and straight and of course celebrating friendship.</p><p>It all barrels along, with a journey-of-discovery narrative template not entirely dissimilar to the recent <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/may/08/book-club-the-next-chapter-review-diane-keaton-jane-fonda-smirking-sequel">Book Club sequel</a>; the energy levels are high and there are some outrageous gags, between which the mandatory sentimentality is reasonably managed although occasionally the sex-positivity theme is rather earnestly signalled.

When she refused, Disney blacklisted her. This story lost a little of its potency last month with the announcement that Polley was set <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/jun/13/sarah-polley-disney-live-action-bambi-remake">to direct the new “live-action” reboot of Bambi</a>. For admirers of Polley’s determinedly independent career, the record-scratch noise could not be louder: this is somebody who worked with Atom Egoyan, David Cronenberg and <em>Hal Hartley for </em><em>God’s sake</em>, before the age of 22.</p><p>Thoughts of Polley returned this week with the now-deafening noise surrounding the release of Barbie, directed by another former queen of independent cinema, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/jul/09/it-had-to-be-totally-bananas-greta-gerwig-on-bringing-barbie-back-to-life">Greta Gerwig</a>. Coming up a few years after Polley, Gerwig was so indie that her films didn’t even go to Sundance, they went to South by Southwest. She was so indie that when she moved from micro-budget mumblecore movies to a scripted film with Noah Baumbach – Greenberg, in 2010 – the Guardian <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2010/jun/05/greta-gerwig-greenberg-mumblecore">called it</a> “her first tentative steps into the mainstream”. Greenberg was made for a budget of $25m, which it didn’t make back; now Gerwig has directed Barbie, for the film arm of mega-corporation Mattel, with a budget of $145m. Gerwig’s swerve into the<em> actual</em> mainstream prompts the question: does the phrase “selling out” have any meaning any more?</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/jul/19/barbie-indie-director-film-maker-greta-gerwig">Continue reading...</a></div><span class="date">Published on: Wed, 19 Jul 2023 10:42:00 GMT</span></div><hr><div class='item'><h2><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/jul/17/latest-mission-impossible-shows-the-silent-asian-stereotype-is-alive-and-well" target="_blank">Latest Mission: Impossible shows the ‘silent Asian’ stereotype is alive and well</a></h2><div class="description"><p>Pom Klementieff’s assassin Paris is largely mute throughout the latest instalment of the franchise, flying in the face of more enlightened recent film roles</p><p>There are many things wrong with Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One: its ridiculous storyline about AI, its bloated runtime, the plot holes as wide as Tom Cruise’s gleaming megawatt smile, but the most jarring of all?

But Sands turned out to be a rarer, stranger and more exotic flower than any of them, virtually impossible to cast as a conventional lead and almost as difficult as a character turn. And this was due to his extraordinarily (and to his fans, hypnotically) eccentric screen presence – distrait, elegant, deadly serious and otherworldly – and that utterly distinctive voice: softly melodious, slightly strangulated, nasal and decelerated; he delivered lines at about 60 to 70% of the speed at which other actors spoke. These were mannerisms that became more pronounced and sometimes baffling as he got older. And yet there was always a charisma in his oddity that gave him a long and busy screen career, particularly in horror and cult movies in which audiences loved him.</p><p>I will always remember his breakthrough appearance in the Merchant-Ivory movie A Room With a View, in which he played George Emerson, the innocently honest lover of art from a déclassé background whose unaffected passion captivates Helena Bonham Carter’s Lucy Honeychurch in Florence – and is in sharp distinction to her pretentious, unfeeling fiance Cecil Vyse, played by Daniel Day-Lewis. Sands’s George leaps impulsively into trees, declaiming “Beauty! Beauty!” and kisses Lucy in a poppy field with a mad audacity which is of a piece with his defiant, weirdly innocent admiration for her loveliness.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/jun/27/julian-sands-an-hypnotically-exotic-actor-full-of-style-and-extravagance">Continue reading...</a></div><span class="date">Published on: Tue, 27 Jun 2023 21:30:46 GMT</span></div><hr><div class='item'><h2><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/jun/22/oscars-best-stunts-john-wick" target="_blank">Academy, take action: why there should be an Oscar for best stunts</a></h2><div class="description"><p>The director of John Wick: Chapter 4 has revealed that he is in discussions with the Academy to officially recognise the power of action sequences – and it couldn’t happen quickly enough</p><p>You could ask a million different people what they want from the Oscars, and you’d get a million different replies.

This was a period that gloriously co-existed with her recurring appearances on The Morecambe and Wise Show. Jackson revered Eric and Ernie to the end of her life, because apart from their own value, her guest-spots on their programme led to her being cast in the 1973 Hollywood comedy A Touch of Class, which in turn gave Jackson her second Oscar, the title tacitly describing what this Rada-trained English actor was giving the movie. The first Oscar was for playing Gudrun in Lawrence’s Women in Love, a film which became part of her longstanding association with Ken Russell, a film-maker who respected her distinctive combination of seriousness, playfulness and sexiness.</p><p>Jackson had made an impression in the movies in the late 60s with Peter Brook’s film version of Marat/Sade as Charlotte Corday, the role she had played on the Broadway stage, and also in Peter Medak’s cult item Negatives, opposite Peter McEnery, as the couple who like to fantasise about being the murderer Dr Crippen and his lover Ethel Le Neve. But the Lawrentian drama Women in Love in 1969 took her aura of countercultural daring closer to the mainstream, in which she played the sensual Gudrun, entranced with Gerald Crich, played by that other seductive icon, Oliver Reed. Of course, all women in that film were bound to be upstaged by the sausage-party outrageousness of Oliver Reed and Alan Bates wrestling naked in front of the fire. But Jackson, in her angular poise and hungriness, was the film’s driving force.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/jun/15/fierce-sensual-cerebral-how-glenda-jackson-brought-class-to-cinema">Continue reading...</a></div><span class="date">Published on: Thu, 15 Jun 2023 14:03:49 GMT</span></div><hr><div class='item'><h2><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/jun/07/marvel-actors-criticise-superhero-films-chris-hemsworth-elizabeth-olsen" target="_blank">Chris Hemsworth thinks Thor has become ‘too silly’ – if superheroes are turning on Marvel, is endgame nigh?</a></h2><div class="description"><p>Hemsworth and Elizabeth Olsen are among the MCU stars – a group of people who once lived in mortal fear of the Marvel brass – to break rank and criticise their latest films</p><p>It is no secret that the tide has been slowly turning against the MCU.
